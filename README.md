# File Read & Write Challenge & Error Handling Lab

This Python program demonstrates how to read a file, modify its contents, and write the modified version to a new file. It also includes error handling to ensure that the program behaves gracefully when encountering issues such as missing files or read/write errors.

## Features

- **File Reading**: Opens a file and reads its entire content.
- **File Modification**: Modifies the file content (e.g., converts text to uppercase).
- **File Writing**: Writes the modified content to a new file.
- **Error Handling**: Handles common errors such as:
  - File not found.
  - Issues with reading or writing files.
  - Unexpected errors during execution.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x or higher.
- A text file that you want to read and modify.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Ensure you have a text file to read from.
3. Run the script in your terminal or IDE:

   ```bash
   python file_read_write.py
